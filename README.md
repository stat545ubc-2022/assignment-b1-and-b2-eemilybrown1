This repository contains the code and outputs of Assignment b1 for the course Stat545B at UBC. It will eventually also contain the code for Assignment b2 as well, however those updates are to come.
In this assignment I produced a function which creates quick histograms to compare bin width sizes. 
You can see and edit the source code using the .Rmd file. The output document is the .md file which is more readable. Files for graphics in the .md file are contained in the assignment_b1-files folder.
