This repository contains the code and outputs of Assignments b1 and b2 for the course Stat545B at UBC. 
In assignment 1 I produced a function which creates quick histograms to compare bin width sizes. 
You can see and edit the source code using the .Rmd file. The output document is the .md file which is more readable. Files for graphics in the .md file are contained in the assignment_b1-files folder.
In assignment 2 I created a package for this function, contained in the folder quickhist in this repository. All associated documentation and code can be found in the quickhist folder.
