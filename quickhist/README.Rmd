The goal of quickhist is to create a quick histogram for a specified variable and bin width. It is especially useful for choosing the appropriate bin width for your data.


Installation instructions: 

```{r}
devtools::install_github("stat545ubc-2022/assignment-b1-and-b2-eemilybrown/quickhist")
```

The function quick_hist() can be used as such, by specifying the variable to be plotted and the bin width:

```{r}
library(datateachr)
quick_hist(vancouver_trees, 
           x = date_planted, 
           100)
```
